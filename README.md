This was a game we had to implement for an introductory course on
Prolog. It's a basic implementation of the game. I extended it by
adding a AI player that uses some advanced techniques to reduce the
search space. This game has a 36! node search space so it's impossible
to do much deep search. Read the code to see what it does instead.

It has been tested on SICStus Prolog and should work on SWI Prolog as
well but there are no guarantees.
